## WebSocket Chat
https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/2018-Q3/tasks/chat.md
## Requirements:
- [X] React
- [ ] Redux
- [X] Nickname should be stored in [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and reused across app launches.
- [X] You should implement reconnection mechanism
- [X] Add notifications for new messages
- [X] Display notification **_only_** when app is **not visible**
- [X] You should separately handle cases when the app goes online/offline
- [X] App should properly work in latest stable chrome
- [X] Your implementation of chat should be deployed and available anywhere by a public link. (My recommend hosting is [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)). Please add a link to the deployed app to the PR.
